# Energy Optimization Problem with Pyomo

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate energy market optimization problems using **[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)**, a Python-based optimization modeling library.  
The notebooks explore different bidding zone setups and illustrate how optimization techniques can be applied to electricity market problems.

## Repository Contents

1. **Single Bidding Zone with varying period.ipynb**  
   Models a single bidding zone where demand and supply vary across different time periods.  
   Demonstrates how temporal variability influences market clearing and optimization results.

2. **Single Bidding Zone.ipynb**  
   A simpler version with a single bidding zone and fixed time period.  
   Introduces the fundamental market clearing mechanism using optimization.

3. **Two Bidding Zone with Transmission.ipynb**  
   Extends the model to two interconnected bidding zones with transmission constraints.  
   Explores how cross-border capacity and transmission limits affect energy prices and flows.
